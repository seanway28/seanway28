- 👋 Hi, I’m @seanway28, but you can call me Sean!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, full stack development, cyber security and new opportunities. I believe I can combine this new knowledge with by previous 10+ years as a Project Manager for several Caterpillar dealerships and corporate offices and my time at General Electric that gave me the inspiration to start my coding studies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about GitHub, CSS, HTML and full stack code development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate anything that can help me and anyone else grow in knowledge and practice. I bring knowledge and well over a decade of electrical engineering and project management from both Caterpillar and General Electric. 
- 📫 You can best reach me at the following email address seanway28@gmail.com
