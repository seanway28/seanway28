- 👋 Hi, I’m @seanway28, but you can call me Sean!
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development, mobile app development, cyber security and other new opportunities. I believe I can combine this new knowledge with by previous 10+ years as a Project Manager for several Caterpillar dealerships and corporate offices and my time at General Electric that gave me the inspiration to start my coding studies.
- 🌱 I’m a graduate of the Butler University Full Stack Code Development Executive Bootcamp Program!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate anything that can help me and anyone else grow in knowledge and practice. I bring knowledge and well over a decade of electrical engineering and project management experience from both Caterpillar and General Electric. 
- 📫 You can best reach me at the following email address seanway28@gmail.com
- You can view my most recent collaborative project @ https://github.com/seanway28/InterstellarWellness.git
